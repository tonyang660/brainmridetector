# BrainMRIDetector AI Model

AI Project done for the AI Launch Lab in partnership with Dawson AI and Mitacs

This model identifies images of brain mri and classifies them in these categories: 

**No Tumor**: Healthy brain without abnormalities.​

**Glioma**: Cancerous tumor in the brain's supportive tissue; aggressive and often fatal.​

**Meningioma**: Tumor in the meninges (brain/spinal cord covering); usually non-cancerous but can cause complications.​

**Pituitary Tumor**: Abnormal growth in the pituitary gland; typically, non-cancerous but affects hormones and can cause symptoms like vision issues and fatigue.​
